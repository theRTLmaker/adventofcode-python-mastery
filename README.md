# Advent of Code - Python Mastery 🎄🐍

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I tackle the daily coding challenges from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) using Python, showcasing problem-solving skills, clean code practices, and efficient algorithms.

---

## Project Goals
- **Daily Challenge Completion**: Solve all puzzles from December 1st to 25th.
- **Pythonic Excellence**: Write clean, idiomatic Python code using best practices.
- **Algorithm Mastery**: Explore efficient solutions leveraging:
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Graph Traversals
  - Data Structures (e.g., heaps, stacks, queues)
  - Recursion and Iterative approaches
- **Documentation**: Provide clear explanations and comments for each solution.
